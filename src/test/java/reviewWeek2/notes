Radio Button
how
1) find the radio button  using any locator and then simply use a click operation
2) you write down a locator that is able to select all the desired options.
    loop through all the options one by one
    {
    if(text or attribute to differentiate in our desired option)
   {
    we click or any other operation that we want to }
}

DropDown
Single Select:you an only select one of the options
1) check if there is a Select tag  thaen we can use the Select class from
Selenium to deal with
*fins the drop down
*use select class
new select(dd)
*selectbyIndex
*SelectbyValue
*SelectbyVisibleText

 if there is not Select tag
 1)  inspect and find the dropdown and perform the click operation
  so it shows the values.
 2) once the values are opened up,write down an Xpath that is able to select all
 the options
 3)  Write loop to go through  all the options.
 if(gettext.equals()){
 perform a click operation.
 }
Multi Select:
multisleect has some extra options
deselectbytext
deselectbyindex
deselectbyvisibletext

Alerts:
alerts are pop-ups and we need to get rid of them when they appear.
there are 3 types
1 ) WEb based:
2)  Window based:
3)  JavaScript; you cant inspect them.
you need to change selenium focus from main page to alert.
