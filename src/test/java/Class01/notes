what is web elements?
Everything that you see on the website is an webElement

Selenium we have locators that helps us find these elements

8 locators:
1) ID  = find the element by ID whose value is ("a")
2) name
3) class
4) Tagname
5) tagName
6) linkText 1)there needs to be a tag<a>
            2) it has some text

7) Partial linkText






why do we have so many locators
1) some of the locators might not be available
2)some times the locator value might not be unique enough
