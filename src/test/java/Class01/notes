what is web elements?
Everything that you see on the website is an webElement

Selenium we have locators that helps us find these elements

8 locators:
1) ID  = find the element by ID whose value is ("a")
2) name
3) class
4) Tagname
5) linkText ---------> 1)there needs to be a tag<a>
            ---------> 2) it has some text
6) Partial linkText

7) xpath
8) css


why do we have so many locators
1) some of the locators might not be available
2)some times the locator value might not be unique enough
Try to find a locator  unique enough since Seleium is going to inspect to[ to bottom
and gives you the first match

if there is locator has numbers in it  we should try to avoid it since numbers are dynamic
it changes  when you go to the website next time.
